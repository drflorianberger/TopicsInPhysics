# Intracellular Transport

One fundamental aspect of all life on a cellular scale is the ability to separate chemical processes in space and time.

Sophisticated transport systems driven by molecular motors supply different parts of a cell with different materials. 

What the physical principles of these systems are and how they are regulated is largely unknown.

A reductionist's approach: can we understand large-range transport by molecular motors, if we know how single motors function and how they interact?

Can we predict the cargo run length or velocity if we know the single-molecule properties?
