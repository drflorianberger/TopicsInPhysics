Week 2: Exercises
=======================
 
2.1) **2 Points** What is the average current through a voltage-gated ion channel in the steady-state ($t\to \infty$) as a function of voltage? The current is the product of two voltage-dependent quantities. What is the equation and what is the general shape (plot a generic case)? 
<br />
<br />

2.2) **2 Points** Given the following variance of the current as a function of the mean current from a cell. What is the single-channel current and how many channels are involved?

2.3) **1 Point** You only have an incomplete measurement of only the initial part of the variance of the current as a function of the mean current. This data can be well approximated with the red line in the plot. What quantities can you still determine from this measurement and what are their values?

2.4) Time-dependent solution of a two-state channel:
What is the time-dependent open probability $\Po(t)$ of the simple two-state channel model given in equation {eq}`eq:2state` 
<br />
<br />

2.5) A three-state channel: Consider the following state diagram for a channel with two closed states:

Determine the steady-state open probability. Now we assume that the rate $k_{12} = k_{12}^0 e^{\alpha V}$ depends on the voltage. What is the shape of the open probability as a function of voltage? How does the variance of the current from a cluster of three-state channels vary with the mean current? Is it still a quadratic function?
