# Optical traps and kinesin's randomness

The free energy release of ATP hydrolysis is on the order of $24 kT = 4.1 \rm{pN} \rm{nm}$. If the step size of a motor is on the order of nm, we expect that the force that a single motor can produce is on the order of pN.  

To measure pN forces and the position of proteins, investigators use optical traps. The basic idea is to bind a single molecule to a sub-micron dielectric bead and then exert forces on this bead by using a focused laser.

Recall that light has momentum that is proportional to the energy $E$ and the refractive index $n_i$ of media $i$,

$$
 p = \frac{E n_i}{c},
$$
in which $c$ is the speed of light. Because of light refraction, the momentum is changed, resulting in a non-zero net force.

In a laser beam with an intensity profile, the bead will experience a net force pushing towards the center of the beam.

With such a set up it is possible to study the physics of molecular motors and measure their movement and position as a function of time. 

Kinesin's randomness has been reported:

The first study that shows that kinesin is not a one-step Poisson stepper $r<1$:

[Kinesin is not a one-step stepper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.25.11782)

When considering backward steps, the randomness can increase $r>1$:

Using novel tools, the randomness can be measured more precisely:
