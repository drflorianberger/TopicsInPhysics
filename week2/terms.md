# Terms and concepts used in the paper

- Membrane with channels

In biology, different compartments are separated by membranes. Different ionic solutions in these compartments result in different potentials (voltages) between these compartments. Proteins in the membrane can regulate the flow of ions, either by pumping or open pores for specific ions.  Channels are proteins in a membrane that allow ions to traverse through their pores. Channels can be gated with different mechanisms, here we consider voltage-gated ion channels. The current through a single channel when its open is called the single-channel current.
