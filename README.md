### Stochastic physics: from fluctuations of molecules of life to the stock market 

In complex systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, such as in living cells or in the stock market, observables can often be described as stochastic processes. After a gentle introduction of the mathematical and computational tools to describe and analyze stochastic processes, we will investigate four systems: i) Stochastic dynamics of ion channels, which are specialized proteins that underlie neuronal signaling; ii) The fluctuations of molecular motors that transform chemical energy into mechanical energy to drive active processes in cells; iii) Cooperativity of molecular motors to mediate long-range transport in cells. iv) Random walks down wall street. In all these examples, we will derive stochastic models that provide a deeper insight into the fascinating dynamics of these systems.
