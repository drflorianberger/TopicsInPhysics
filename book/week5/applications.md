### A random walk down wall street

Burton G. Malkiel argued in his book 'A random walk down wall street' that asset prices display signs of random walks and that you cannot outperform market averages.

In Fig 2.3 you see the closing price of 500 stocks corrected for inflation and divided by the average return. This graph seems like a random walk to me, right?
