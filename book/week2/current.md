How electrical currents are related to the electrical potentials

## Ohm's law
The movement of ions generates electric currents. Ohm's law relates the current $I$ with the resistance $R$ and the voltage $V$, as

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

Introducing the conductance $G=1/R$ Ohm's law can be written as

$$
I = G V
$$ (eq:ohm)

## Ohm's laws for cells

To apply Ohm's laws for cells, we have to consider that the membrane potential of cells may not be zero at rest. This resting potential is largely a result of the equilibrium potentials of different ions, as we discussed earlier in {ref}`sec:sep`. In short for physicists, the reference point for a cell's membrane potential is outside of the cell.     

To account for the resting potential we have to extent equation {eq}`eq:ohm` with the resting potential $V_{\rm{rest}}$,

$$
I = G(V - V_{\rm{rest}})
$$
