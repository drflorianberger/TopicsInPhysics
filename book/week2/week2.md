Week 2: Fluctuation of Ion Channels
=======================

In the second week we will use fluctuation analysis to gain insight into the organization of ion channels

- Electrical charges are separated by ion channels
- What is the electrical current through ion channels
- Gating of ion channels
- Stochastic dynamics of ion channels
- Fluctuation analysis
- Fluctuation analysis of voltage-gated channel
- Open question in the field
