=======================

In the second week we will use fulcutation anaysis to gian insight into the the organization of ion channels

- Electrical charges are separated by ion channels
- What is the electrical current through ion channels
- Gating of ion channels
- Stochastic dynamics of ion channels
- Fluctuation analysis
- Open question in the field
