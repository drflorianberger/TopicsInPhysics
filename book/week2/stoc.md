How to describe the stochastic dynamics of ion channels
```
Ion channels are proteins embedded in membranes. When their pore is open, ions can diffuse through. The opening and closing of the pore are associated with a conformational change of the protein: a change in its shape. Because proteins display fluctuations in a thermal environment, the opening and closing dynamics of ion channels are best represented by a stochastic description.

The simplest approach is to assign an open state $(o)$ and a closed state (c) to the channel, and describe the transition between the open and closed states with the rate $\koc$ and the reverse transition with $\kco$.

Now, we can write down the Master equation for the time evolution of the probabilities:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \Po = - \koc \Po + \kco \Pc \\
\frac{d}{dt} \Pc = - \kco \Pc + \koc \Po \\
$$ (eq:2state)

With the normalization requirement $\Po + \Pc = 1$, we can solve this equations, see EXERSICES.

$$
\frac{\Po}{\Pc} = \frac{\kco}{\koc} = e^{-\Delta E/kT}
$$

The last equation relates the state probabilities to the energy difference of these states (Boltzmann).
