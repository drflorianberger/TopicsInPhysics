# Molecular Motors

Molecular motors are specialized proteins that transduce chemical free energy into mechanical motion. They form the basis for muscle activity, but also mediate directed long-range transport. For example, the axon of neurons can be up to 1m in humans. To cover such long-range transport only by diffusion would be inefficient. 

Microtubules (MTs) in cells are filaments that provide the "highways" for these motor proteins. Molecules of the kinesin motor family step along MTs in a coordinated fashion by binding to and unbinding from the repetitive structure:

As a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, directed motion cannot spontaneously occur. Kinesin uses the energy from the organic compound ATP by hydrolyzing it into ADP. The free energy from this reaction is on the order of $24 kT$ and transduced into a mechanical step.

### Biophysics of Molecular Motors

There are many interesting questions about molecular motors that have been addressed in the past decades:

- How can we measure, speed, force generation, structural rearrangements, and chemical reactions.
- How do these motors respond to forces
- Do we need a new theoretical framework to describe these thermodynamic engines? Their dynamics is stochastic. Therefore we need to develop "stochastic thermodynamics and energetics"
