# Comment on the paper

In the paper they describe the position as:

$$
x(t) = d N(t) + \eta(t),
$$
with mean
$$
\mean{x(t)} = \mean{d N(t) + \eta(t)} = d \mean{N(t)}
$$

and variance

$$
mean{(x-\mean{x})^2} = dkt + 2 \mean{\eta^2}
$$

However the factor two comes in from their definition of the sample variance which is defined in terms of a mean square displacement.

Note. The difference of two gaussian variables with the same mean and variance is a gaussian random variable (with $2\sigma$). The distribution of this is a chi distribution and the mean of the chi distribution is the variance.
