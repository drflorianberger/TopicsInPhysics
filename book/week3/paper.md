Week 3: Paper
=======================

We will discuss the following paper about the randomness of a molecular motor:

[Fluctuation analysis of molecular motors](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.25.11782)

This is a real scientific paper with high-level content. Do not get stuck at details. Try to identify what you learned in the lectures and think about the overall goal of the study.

We will discuss the following questions:

1) Does the title and the abstract reflect the content of the paper?

2) How does equation (1) and (2) scale with time?

3) What is shown in Fig. 1 ?

4) Why do the authors use computer simulations and what do they want to show with it?

5) What is shown in Fig. 2 ?

6) What do the different slopes in Fig. 2 indicate?
