Welcome
============================
Here, you will find most of the material that I cover in the 5-weeks course "Stochastic Physics of the Molecules of Life".

A typical week consists of a lecture, a paper discussion, and exercises. 

If you have any questions, please contact me directly.

Have fun and enjoy the material!
