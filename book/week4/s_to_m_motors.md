# From Single Motors to Multiple Motors

### Characteristics of a single motor

What motors can do:
- Walk along a filament (velocity)
- Bind to a filament (binding rate)
- Unbinding from a filament (unbinding rate)

In principle this can depend on several quantities:
- Fule (free energy, ATP)
- Force


The force-dependent behavior of single molecular motors has been studied with optical traps

### Force-velocity relation

The velocity of motor decreases with an oposing force

- Force-free velocity $v_0$
- Stall force $\Fs$

### Binding and unbinding

Binding process is complicated but we assume to effectively describe it with a single rate

$$
\pi
$$

The unbinding process depends on the external force. It is intuitive to consider that this rate increases with the force on the molecular bond.

The most accepted model is an exponential force-dependence of the unbinding rate

$$
\e = \e_0 e^{F/\Fd},
$$

in which $\e_0$ is the force-free unbinding rate and $\Fd$ is the detachment force, a characteristic force scale.
