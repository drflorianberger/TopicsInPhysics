Week 4: Paper
=======================

This week we will discuss the following paper about a theoretical model to investigate cooperative transport by molecular motors

[Cooperative transport by molecular motors]( https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0507363102)

You should be able to understand most of it. However, deriving the distributions of walking times and run length are mathematically difficult.

This is a real scientific paper with high-level content and tools from theoretical physics. Do not get stuck in details. Try to identify what you learned in the lectures and think about the overall goal of the study.

We will discuss the following questions:

1) Does the title and the abstract reflect the content of the paper?

2) What is illustrated in Fig.1 ?

3) Which equation represents the master equation for the system?

4) Why are the bound probabilities given by $P_n/(1-P_0)$. What are the $P_n$?

5) What is given in equation 12. What is the underlying assumption here? Think about, if the motors are independent from each other or not?

6) One of the main results is in equation 14. Is the scaling of the run length with the total number $N$ of motors linear or exponential?

7) What is shown in Fig. 3?
