Week 4: Paper
=======================

This week we will discuss the following paper about a theoretical model to investigate cooperative transport by molecular motors

[Cooperative transport by molecular motors]( https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0507363102)

You should be able to understand most of it. However, deriving the distributions of walking times and run length are mathematically difficult.
