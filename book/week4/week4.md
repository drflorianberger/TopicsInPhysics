Week 4: Long-range transport of intracellular cargos
=======================

In the fourth week, we will study stochastic models of long-range transport of intracellular cargos

- Intracellular cargo transport
- From single motor to multiple motors?
- Force-dependence of single moleuclar motor
- Stochastic description of cooperative transport
- Critical examination of the simplifications
- Open question in the field
