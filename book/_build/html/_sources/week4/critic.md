# Critique of the Model

### What are the underlying assumptions?

- Single motor behavior
- Force sharing
- Identical motors
- Interaction between the motors

### Experimental validation

It is extremely difficult to control the number of functioning motor proteins in an experiment. Experimentalists successfully developed DNA origami techniques to couple precisely motor proteins.

In the load-free case, what would we expect from our model?

The average time that both motors are bound to the filament should be half the average binding time of a single motor:

$$
\mean{t}_2 = 0.5*\mean{t}_1,
$$

but the velocity should be the same (load-free case)

$$
v_2 = v
$$

However, these experiments suggested that

$$
\mean{t} = 0.15*\mean{t}_1
$$

and

$$
v_2 = v_1
$$

Possible explanation:

- Negative interference between the motors
