# Intracellular Transport

One fundamental aspect of all life on a cellular scale is the ability to separate chemical processes in space and time.

Sophisticated transport systems driven by molecular motors supply different parts of a cell with different material. 

What the physical principles of these systems are and how they are regulated is largly unkown.

A reductionist's approach: can we understand large-range transport by molecular motors, if we know how single motors function and how they interact?

Can we predict the cargo run length or velocity if we know the single molecule properties?
