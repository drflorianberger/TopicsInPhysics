# Optical traps and kinesin's randomness

```{admonition} You will learn
the concept of randomness

The free energy release of ATP hydrolysis is on the order of $24 kT = 4.1 pN nm$. If the step size of a motor is on the order of nm, we expect that the force that a single motor can produce is on the order of pN.  

To measure pN forces and the position of proteins, investigators use optical traps. The basic idea is to bind a single molecule to a sub-micron dielectric bead and then exert forces on this bead by using a focused laser.

DRAWING Motor molecule and BEAD

Recall that light has momentum that is proportional to the energy $E$ and the refractive index $n_i$ of media $i$,

$$
 p = \frac{E n_i}{c},
$$
in which $c$ is the speed of light. Because of light refraction the momentum is changed resulting in a non-zero net force.

DRAWING

In a laser beam with an intensity profile, the bead will experience a net force pushing towards the center of the beam.

With such a set up it is possible to study the physics of molecular motors and measure their movement and position as a function of time. 

Kinesin's randomness has been reported:

The first study that shows that kinesin is not a one-step poisson stepper $r<1$:

When considering backward steps the randomness can increase $r>1$:

With novel tools the randomness can be better measured:
