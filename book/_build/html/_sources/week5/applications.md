### A random walk down wall street

Burton G. Malkiel argued in his book 'A random walk down wall street' that asset prices disply signs of random walks and that you cannot outperfom markt averages.

In Fig 2.3 you see the closing price of 500 stocks corrected for inflation and divided by the average return. This seems like a random walk to me, right?
