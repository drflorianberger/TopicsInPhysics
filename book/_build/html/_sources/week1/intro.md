# Introduction to Biophysics

### The Subject

- 'Biophysics', 'Biological Physics', 'Physical Biology' have come to mean many different things in different communities.
- An exciting new field!! Is it Physics? Is it Biology? Is it in between?
- Academic disciplines are often defined by their objects of study or by their style of inquiry.
- Biology: the study of life
- Physics: more about the style, "Thinking like a physicist"
- Galileo: "The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"
- Ernst Mayr: "Living organisms must be understood at every level of organization; they cannot be reduced to the laws of physics and chemistry."
- "I don't care, I just want to do interesting science!"
- Antidisciplinary!
- The disinterested pursuit of an understanding of nature.
- What is life? We are not looking for a new kind of force!
- We are studyig this mysterious condition under which physical forces cause material to self-organize to living systems.


### The Past

Many researchers crossed disciplines:
- Kepler: Snowflakes, harmony, psychology and science fiction
- Helmholtz: Vision and Hearing
- Ernst Mach: Balance
- Max Delbruck: Molecular Medicine
- Lawrence Bragg: X-Ray, structures of molecules

Key contributions:
- Emmy Noether: Conservation of energy and time symmetry
- Marie Curie: Radiation
- Rosalind Franklin: Photo 51, X-ray of DNA
- Barbara McClintock: Jumping genes
- Doudna & Charpentier: CRISPR 

### The Present

- Interdisciplinary acceptance
- Specific new research areas: mechanobiology, membrane-less organelles, predictable evolution, from genes to embryos, limits on biological performance.

### The Futur

- Unifying theoretical principles of life?
- Models in biology: 'accurate descriptions of our pathetic thinking'
- Predictions (correlations vs. causality)
- Alpha fold
