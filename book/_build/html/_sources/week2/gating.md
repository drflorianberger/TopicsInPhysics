# Gating of Ion Channels

```{admonition} You will learn
The concept of gating
```
The opening and closing of ion channels can be induced by different stimuli. This mechanism is called gating. Ion channels can be categorized depending on their gating mechanism:
- Voltage-gated channels
- Tension-gated channels
- Ligand-gated channels
- Temperature-gated channels
- Light-gated channels

In our simple description of the channel dynamics, a gating mechanism with stimulus S changes the energy difference between the closed and the open state

$$
\Delta E = \Delta E(S)
$$ 

To linear order, we can assume that the energy difference decreases linearly with the stimulus, thus increasing the probability that the channel is open:

$$
\frac{\Po}{\Pc} = e^{-\Delta E(S)/kT}
$$

Voltage-gated ion channel increase their open probability by an increasing membrane voltage V. In our description, we assume a linear dependence: $\Delta E(V) = -\alpha V + \beta$, with the two free parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Together with $\Po + \Pc = 1$ and

$$
\frac{\Po}{\Pc} = e^{-\Delta E(V)/kT}, 
$$

we derive the steady-state probability

$$
\Po(V) = \frac{1}{1+e^{(\beta - \alpha V)/kT}}
$$

In experiments the voltage is changed instantaneously with a step. We expect from EQ that there is a transient behavior of the open probability and therefore it depends on time and voltage:

$$
\Po = \Po(V,t).
