How to describe the stochastic dynamics of ion channels
```
Ion channels are proteins embedded in membranes. When their pore is open, ions can diffuse through. The opening and closing of the pore are associated with a conformational change of the protein: a change in its shape. Because proteins display fluctuations in a thermal environment, the opening and closing dynamics of ion channels are best represented by a stochastic description.

The simplest approach is to assign an open state $(o)$ and a closed state (c) to the channel, and describe the transition between the open and closed states with the rate $k_{\rm{oc}}$ and the reverse transition with $k_{\rm{oc}}$.
